## Security Notice

Starting with v1.2.0, this package implements enterprise-grade security measures. All provider URLs undergo strict validation, and the provider database is cryptographically verified for integrity.

For security concerns, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Migration Guide

### From v1.1.x to v1.2.0

‚úÖ **No breaking changes** - all existing APIs remain compatible

**Optional security enhancements:**
```typescript
// Optional: Use secure loading for enhanced validation
import { secureLoadProviders } from '@mikkelscheike/email-provider-links/security';

const result = secureLoadProviders();
if (result.securityReport.securityLevel === 'CRITICAL') {
  // Handle security incident
}
```

**New security features are automatic:**
- All URLs are automatically validated
- HTTPS enforcement is built-in
- Malicious patterns are blocked automatically

### From v1.0.x to v1.1.x

‚úÖ **No breaking changes** - backward compatible

### First Time Installation

```bash
npm install @mikkelscheike/email-provider-links
```
